### Options

#### --cookie-file=COOKIE_FILE

> [!NOTE] Starting with v0.3.0-rc1, `julesjordan`, `manuelferrara`,
> `rickysroom`, `s3xus`, `spizoo` and `ztod` do not need you to manually fetch the cookies
> from the website. The tool will automatically spawn a headless browser session
> that will ask your login credentials and store them in a file for reuse.

If you want to download from a premium website (one that requires a membership),
you would need to get your session cookie. If you use Mozilla Firefox, you can
use the extension[
cookies.txt](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) to
store your session cookies to a text file. Login to the website using your
credentials and use the extension to download your cookies to a file (preferably
named `cookies.txt`). When you can the tool, it will look for the cookie file in
the current directory. Alternatively, you can pass in your cookie file by
passing the parameter `--cookie=../path/to/cookie/file.txt`

#### --downloader=DOWNLOADER

The tool uses external tools to download videos. Currently it supports
`youtube-dl` or `yt-dlp`. Download youtube-dl from
[https://youtube-dl.org/](https://youtube-dl.org/) or download `yt-dlp` from
[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

You need to ensure that the tool is available in your $PATH. One way to verify
is executing `which youtube-dl` in your shell. If you don't see an error, you're
all set. Also ensure that you have the dependencies required by the downloader
(usually ffmpeg and ffprobe). This is required to decrypt HLS streams. By
default, the tool will use youtube-dl.

#### --store=STORE

The tool tracks all downloads in a file called `adt_download_status.store`. DO
NOT edit this file and preferably don't delete it as well. This is used to
prevent downloading duplicate scenes. By default, the tool will look for this
file in the current directory and will create one if it's not present.

#### --parallel=N

Support parallel downloads to speed up the process. By default this value is 1.
Do not increase this to a high number or the adulttime API will rate limit you.

#### --log-level

Indicate the level of logging. The default value is `info`. You can set the
following values: `extra`, `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` and
`fatal`. `extra` will push a lot of logs so it's recommended to use this for
debugging or raising issues.

## FAQ

### Are all supported sites require a premium membership?

No, sites like `goodporn` and `cumlouder` are free to use and don't require a
premium membership.

### How do I get my session cookie?

Refer to [the cookie](# --cookie-file=COOKIE_FILE) section for more information.
Some sites like `s3xus` and `rickysroom` support dynamic session authentication
and will not require you to manually get your session cookie. Instead, using
these sites will spawn a browser window where you can login and the tool will
get the cookies automatically.

### Can XXX site be supported?

It depends on the site. The tool uses two strategies to download from sites:

* Using the site's APIs: if available, this is the first choice as it's most
  reliable
* Using HTML parsing: this is a fallback is the site doesn't have an API. This
  is less reliable as it makes the site prone to breaking if the site layout
  changes.
* Using browser automation: this is the last resort as it uses a browser to
  navigate the site. Usually this is required if the site does not allow
  downloads or have HLS streams. This method makes the site slow (as controlling
  a browser is slow in itself) and prone to breaking as it still uses HTML
  parsing (although with a different library).

## Ran into an error?

Raise an issue in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/c477y/adulttime_dl/issues) and I'll try to help out.
However, please understand that debugging paid sites require a paid membership
account which I may not have access to so my support may be limited.
